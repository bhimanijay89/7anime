# 7anime — Development Status

## Current Phase

Schedule Page — Real AniList Airing Schedule Data Integration & UI Polish

## Overall Status

Schedule Page has been upgraded to use real AniList `airingSchedules` GraphQL data via backend Upstash Redis caching. All mock schedule entries have been removed. Airing times are dynamically formatted using the browser's local timezone. Includes skeleton loading states, error states with retry, empty states, and responsive design across desktop and mobile screens (320px–430px). All TypeScript (`tsc -b`), build (`npm run build`), and lint (`npm run lint`) checks pass with 0 errors.
